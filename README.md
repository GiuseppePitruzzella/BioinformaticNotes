# Bioinformatics Course Repository

Repository hosts notes, exercises, and files related to the topics covered in the Bioinformatics Course @ FCUP, U.Porto, Portugal.

### Covered Topics

Course covers a series of fundamental topics, starting with molecular biology concepts, which include genetic information, gene structure and regulation, genomes, alternative splicing, and the organization of living things across their three main domains, plus viruses. Subsequently, it moves to the basic processing of biological sequences, addressing the central dogma of molecular biology, sequence representation, basic algorithms, transcription, reverse complement, translation, and finding proteins within genomic sequences. A significant section is dedicated to pairwise sequence alignment, exploring the comparison and visualization of alignments, their formulation as optimization problems, substitution matrices, gap penalties, global (Needleman-Wunsch) and local (Smith-Waterman) alignment algorithms, and the concepts of similarity and homology. The course continues with multiple sequence alignment, discussing the generalization of the problem to multiple sequences, progressive alignments, and applications such as identifying recurrent motifs and phylogenetic analysis. The search for similar sequences in databases using BLAST is then covered, highlighting the need for efficient algorithms for large databases and the implementation of a simplified version of BLAST. Another key topic is sequence pattern finding, which includes basic and heuristic algorithms, regular expressions, and the biological significance of patterns. Phylogenetic analysis is explored through phylogenetic trees, algorithm classes like Hierarchical Clustering and UPGMA, and the implementation of distance-based algorithms. Finally, the course introduces graphs and biological networks, discussing the motivation and examples of networks like protein-protein interactions, graph definitions and representation, network measures, and types of networks.
